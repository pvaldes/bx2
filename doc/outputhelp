People have often commented how they can get color and/or eight bit
characters working when running epic linked against ncurses and running
under gnu screen.

All of this information was graciously provided by johnnie_doe@hotmail.com

COLORS:
-------
To get colors under gnu screen, add these lines to your .screenrc file:

termcap  vt102 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
terminfo vt102 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'

If screen does not default to 'vt102', make sure you set TERM to vt102 before
you run epic.


EIGHT BIT CHARS:
---------------
If epic is linked against ncurses (it is by default), you can set some
ncurses options to make it accept eight bit characters more gracefully.
Add the following lines to your .inputrc:

set meta-flag on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

Then in EPIC, you may need to:
	/set high_bit_escape 0
and you should be on your way.  EPIC4 used to require
	/SET EIGHT_BIT_CHARACTERS ON
but this is now unnecessary in epic5.

If you are using GNU screen, make sure you have "defc1 off" in your 
screenrc file, because screen won't even display characters 128-159
with it on (and it is on by default). (from Ben Winslow, May 16, 1999)

DRAWING CHARACTERS:
-------------------
Fonts come with multiple character sets.  Usually there is a character
set with european national characters ("latin-1"), and another character 
set with box drawing characters ("vga").  These character sets are mutually
exclusive, and epic never forces you to use one or the other (unlike bx, which
forces you into vga mode unconditionally)

So if your font is in latin-1 mode, and your script wants vga mode, then you
will see lots of strange vowels and stuff.  Exit epic, run this command
at your shell:
	echo "X(U" | tr 'X' '\033'
and restart epic.

Good luck!
